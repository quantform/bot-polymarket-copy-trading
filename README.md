## 🧠 How It Works

The bot listens to real-time trade activity from selected Polymarket wallets and automatically replicates their positions on 5-minute crypto prediction markets.

Whenever a monitored wallet opens a position in a newly created market, the bot mirrors the trade by matching the direction (Up/Down), size, and timing as closely as possible. This allows users to follow and copy the execution behavior of other traders without manual intervention.

All trades are executed in near real time, enabling automated participation in short-expiry binary markets based on the activity of chosen wallets.
